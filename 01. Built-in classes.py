# 1st of all we need to know what is class? and what is object?

#   -> class is a blueprint/template for creating objects.
#   -> object is an instance of a class.


# there are the built-in classes in python, such as int, float, str, list, tuple, dict etc.

name = "John"  # str
age = 23  # int

# The type() function returns the class of the object.
print(type(name))  # <class 'str'>
print(type(age))  # <class 'int'>
